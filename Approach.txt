I first read through the task and wrote down the specific requirements I would have to implement. After that, I thought about how I could solve the problem in my head. After some brainstorming, I began to write some test code to see if my idea would work. After testing, I started a new project and began coding the program. During my work on the code, I encountered some issues, such as the tree not being correctly aligned or the star being missing. To address these problems, I used Google to identify the cause and attempted to resolve them. Once my errors were fixed, I ran the program multiple times to ensure that everything works correctly and performed some 'stress testing.' Lastly, I reviewed the code again, optimized some parts, and uploaded it to GitHub.
